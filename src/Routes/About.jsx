          My name is Harshdeep Singh , and I'm the creator of this project. As a developer, I love building things that are both useful and fun. That's why I created this shopping store, which is powered by the Fake Store API, React JS, and Tailwind CSS.
          As a developer, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. That's why I chose to build this project using React JS and Tailwind CSS. These technologies allowed me to create a responsive, fast-loading website that's easy to maintain and update.
          If you have any questions or feedback about this project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. You can find my Github link below, where you can also view the code for this project.
