# Shopping-Store
This project is a ReactJS-based shopping website that leverages the power of Tailwind CSS for styling and layout. The website connects to a fake store API to display a range of products that users can browse and purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, the website integrates the react-use-cart library, which provides a simple and intuitive shopping cart functionality. This project demonstrates the ability to build sophisticated web applications using modern front-end development frameworks and libraries.
